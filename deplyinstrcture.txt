Deploying a full-stack project with a frontend, backend, and database involves a few steps. Here's a breakdown of how you can do it for free, using popular services.

Overall Strategy
Your project has three main parts:

Frontend: A React application (client directory).
Backend: A Node.js/Express server (server directory).
Database: A SQL database (indicated by database/db.sql).
You'll need to deploy the frontend and backend separately. The database will be hosted by a cloud provider, and your backend will connect to it.

Recommended Free Services
Frontend (React):

Vercel: Excellent for React apps, offers automatic deployments from a Git repository, and has a generous free tier.
Netlify: Another great option, very similar to Vercel with a strong free tier.
Backend (Node.js):

Render: A popular choice with a free tier for web services. It can run your Node.js server.
Railway: Another platform that offers a free starter plan.
Database (SQL):

Supabase: Provides a free PostgreSQL database.
ElephantSQL: Offers a free tier for PostgreSQL.
Railway: Also provides a database service.
Deployment Steps
Push to GitHub:

Make sure your entire project is in a GitHub repository. This is how most hosting services will access your code.
Deploy the Database:

Sign up for a service like Supabase or ElephantSQL.
Create a new database instance.
You will get a connection string (URL) for your database. You'll need this for your backend.
You may need to run the db.sql script in your new cloud database to set up the tables. Most database providers have a way to do this through their web interface.
Deploy the Backend (Node.js):

Sign up for Render (or your chosen backend service).
Create a new "Web Service" and connect it to your GitHub repository.
Configuration:
Root Directory: server
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: node server.js (or whatever command you use to start your server).
Environment Variables: You'll need to add environment variables for your database connection string and any other secrets (like JWT keys). This is a crucial step to connect your backend to the database.
Deploy the Frontend (React):

Sign up for Vercel (or your chosen frontend service).
Create a new project and connect it to your GitHub repository.
Configuration:
Root Directory: client
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
Output Directory: build
Environment Variables: You'll need to add a variable (e.g., REACT_APP_API_URL) that points to the URL of your deployed backend (the one you got from Render). You'll need to make sure your frontend code uses this variable to make API calls.
Summary
The key is to host each part of your application on a service that fits its needs and then connect them using environment variables. Using a Git repository will make the process much smoother.
